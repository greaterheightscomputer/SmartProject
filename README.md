SOFTWARE SYSTEM REQUIREMENT
Smart Accessories has decided to expand its business to sell its products all over the world. A new system has been proposed for Smart Accessories to create new routes to market its products, improve its interaction with customers, and streamline its cataloguing capability. The envisioned system will enable only registered users to place an order for purchasing the listed products. The items will be shipped to the customer’s address and an additional shipping charge will be added to the total cost.

The new system will use banners to display the current promotional schemes. For example, a banner can promote new products and any schemes offered to the customers on buying an item.

The core features of the new system are:
•	A Web-enabled interface will enable the customers to view information related to the various products.

•	A single centralized database will be created. It will hold the following information:
•	Details of all the products and customers.
•	Details of the products present in the shopping cart of each customer.
•	Feedback given by customers on various services and product quality.

•	The database will be accessed by three different types of users: customers, nonmembers, and administrator. The website will provide a different interface for each of the three types of users.

•	The interface for nonmembers will provide the following functionality:
•	View the details of all the products.
•	Register with the website to become a member.
•	Search for different types of products based on a particular criteria.

•	The interface for customers will provide the following functionality:
•	Check if an item is available.
•	Add and remove the products from the shopping cart.
•	Purchase products online by using multiple modes of payment.
•	Customize the look and feel of the website.
•	Provide feedback on the various services and product quality.
•	Change the password.

•	The interface for administrator will provide the following functionality:
•	Upload, edit, and view the details of all the products.
•	Upload, edit, and view the promotional schemes to be displayed on the home page of the website.
•	Upload, edit, and view the discount schemes available for the various products.
•	View the feedback given by the customers.
•	Change the administrator password.

The e-commerce system will track the usage patterns of the members and display customized pages according to the usage history. For example, users may have searched for a particular category of accessories on their first visit. When these users log on again, the system will direct them to the Web page corresponding to the category they searched during their previous visit.

The senior management has asked you to develop the Web application with the following additional features so as to secure the application from anonymous users and provide better customer service:

•	The website should validate the user’s name and password before allowing the user to log on to the website.
•	If the user leaves the website idle for more than 5 minutes, then his or her session should be expired and the user should be asked again to log in.
•	The retrieval of the data should be fast so that the user does not have to wait for the data to be displayed for long. In addition, while the data in a part of the page is being displayed, the user should be allowed to interact with the rest of the Web page.
•	The users should be allowed to personalize the website according to their preferences.
•	The user interface of the website should be appealing, easy to understand and access, and consistent. The font size should be large enough so that it can be easily read by people with diminished vision. The colors used in the website should not be bright and dark.

The new system will use a 3-tier architecture, which will consist of the following components:
•	Presentation tier: This layer will consist of Web forms. The forms can be used for different purposes, such as accepting data and displaying the final results to the users.
•	Business logic tier: This layer will contain the code to provide the logic.
•	Data tier: This layer will contain the SQL Server 2005 database to store the relevant data related to the products and the customers.
